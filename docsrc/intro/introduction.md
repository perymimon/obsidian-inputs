# Introduction to Obsidian-Inputs

Existing Obsidian plugins for creating input components are often unstable and slow due to their reliance on complex libraries. This affects your experience and productivity within ObsidianMD, leading to frustration and inefficiency.

Obsidian-Inputs is a lightweight, efficient plugin designed to offer a simple inline-code pattern for creating input and button components in ObsidianMD's preview mode. These components dynamically modify markdown files, ensuring long-term readability even if Obsidian or other plugins fail.
