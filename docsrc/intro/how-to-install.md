If you're interested in testing the Obsidian-Inputs plugin before it's published in the plugin community, follow these steps:

- Download the plugin files from the repository or source provided by the developer.
- Open ObsidianMD and navigate to the Settings pane.
- Click on the "Community plugins" tab.
- Locate the "Developers" section and click on the "Load plugin" button.
- Select the downloaded plugin files from your local directory.
- Once loaded, the plugin will appear in the list of installed plugins.
- Enable the plugin by toggling the switch next to its name.
- Test the plugin's functionality within ObsidianMD to provide feedback and report any issues to the developer.

Please note that as this plugin is still in the testing phase and not yet published in the plugin community, it may have limited features and could encounter bugs or errors. Your feedback as a tester is invaluable in helping improve the plugin before its official release.

If you encounter any issues during the testing process, provide detailed feedback to the developer to assist in troubleshooting and improvement efforts. You can also collaborate with other testers and developers in the ObsidianMD community forums or Discord channels to share experiences and insights.
