#topTableGame #טקסט-שכתבתי/ביקורת-משחק

Brief of yesterday's game:

Each player runs a rabbit kingdom and of course trying to get the most carrot points. in each round each player gets 10 cards, a card can give him a spot in the kingdom, or something to upgrade in his territory or a secret goal, but he can only choose 2 cards! and must transfer the rest to the next player who does the same. After 5 such selections one round ends. And players get a  score according to the quality of their kingdom. Rest Details of the rules for those who come to play next week :) 🥕
