To get to Ordan’s place from LGA, take the M60 bus to the Q Train. On the Q train make sure you’re headed downtown towards Coney Island. At the airport buy a Metrocard – you can use your Metrocard on the bus and subway. Make sure to buy your Metrocard before getting on the bus, or else you’ll have you pay your busfare with exact change, which you might not have. You’ll like the M60 – it’s a beautiful ride with good skyline views over the East River. Make sure you count 9 stops on the M60, sometimes the bus driver doesn’t tell you, and I don’t want you to get lost in Harlem!
